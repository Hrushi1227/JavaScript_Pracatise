            I'm selfish, impatient and a little insecure. I make mistakes, I am out of control and at times hard to
            handle.
            But if you can't handle me at my <a href="#nowhere">worst</a> , then you sure as hell don't deserve me at my
            best.”
            ― Marilyn Monroe

            “You've gotta dance like there's nobody watching,
            Love like you'll never be hurt,
            Sing like there's nobody listening,
            And live like it's heaven on earth.”
